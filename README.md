In this Movie Trivia Game, you can try to answer 7 movie questions within a time limit. When the time limit runs out the answers are not posted so there is still a challenge after it expires. 

The movie questions are multiplechoice; they use radio type buttons. 

The javascript file includes: A startTimer function that formats times, Setting the target/countdown number, Starting the startTimer, Processing Results & The Message After the Timer ends
